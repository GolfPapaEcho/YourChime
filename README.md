# YourChime

Currently an Arduino prototype of a chimer which has 3 functions:

1) Egg or Tea timer (3 min)
2) Metta Bhavana meditation chimer with (10 min x 5)
3) Pomodoro Tecnique chimer. (((20 min work then 5 min break) x 3) then 20 min work then 30 min break ) x 3 execpt on the third time after the last work period (20 min)
the tea timer is called.

The components can all be found on the circuit diagram, however I used a BFY51 as a switch for the solenoid because it is what I had but it has been discontinued, a suitable 
alternative is a 2N3019. The solenoid I used can be found here https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/mini-solenoid?variant=2284520931338

Enjoy!
